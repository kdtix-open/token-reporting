# UAT Testing Guide

> **User Acceptance Testing**: Real-world scenarios with realistic data to verify features work as expected.

---

## What is UAT?

**UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: Manual testing with real or realistic data to verify:
- Features work in real-world scenarios
- Edge cases are handled
- User workflows are smooth
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance meets expectations

**UAT is NOT**:
- Unit testing (covered by automated tests)
- Exploratory testing (UAT has defined scenarios)
- Performance testing (separate activity)
- Security testing (separate activity)

---

## When to Run UAT

### Required UAT Scenarios

**Always run UAT for**:
- ✅ **New features** (verify real-world usage)
- ✅ **Major changes** (verify backward compatibility)
- ✅ **Bug fixes** (verify fix works in production-like environment)
- ✅ **Cross-platform code** (verify on all target platforms)
- ✅ **User-facing APIs** (verify usability)

### Optional UAT

**Consider UAT for**:
- Internal refactoring (if risk of behavioral changes)
- Performance improvements (measure before/after)
- Documentation updates (verify examples work)

---

## UAT Process

### Step 1: Create Test Scenarios

**Template**:
```markdown
## UAT Scenario: [Descriptive Name]

**Goal**: [What are we verifying?]

**Prerequisites**:
- [Environment setup]
- [Test data needed]
- [Configuration requirements]

**Steps**:
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

**Expected Results**:
- [Expected outcome 1]
- [Expected outcome 2]

**Actual Results**:
- [What actually happened]
- [Bugs found (celebrate! 🎉)]
```

### Step 2: Set Up Test Environment

**Environment checklist**:
- [ ] **Staging/test instance** (not production!)
- [ ] **Test data prepared** (realistic but safe)
- [ ] **Credentials configured** (test accounts)
- [ ] **Network access** (if external APIs)
- [ ] **Logging configured** — run with `--verbose 3 --debug 3` for full trace output; log files are captured automatically in `logs/` (see [Observability & Logging Standards](../standards/observability-and-logging.md))

### Step 3: Execute Scenarios

**Execution tips**:
- Follow scenarios exactly as written
- Document deviations or unexpected behavior
- Take screenshots/videos if helpful
- Record timing for performance-sensitive operations
- Celebrate bugs found! 🎉

### Step 4: Document Results

**For each scenario**:
- ✅ **Pass**: Works as expected
- ❌ **Fail**: Doesn't work, bug found (celebrate!)
- ⏳ **Blocked**: Can't test (dependency issue)

**Document failures**:
```markdown
**Actual Results**:
- ❌ Timeout after 30 seconds (expected: complete within 60s)
- ❌ File integrity check failed (checksum mismatch)

**Bugs Found**:
- #42: Upload timeout too short for large files
- #43: Checksum calculation incorrect for binary files

**Status**: Bugs logged, fixes in progress
```

### Step 5: Fix Bugs & Re-test

**Bug fix workflow**:
1. Create issue/ticket for bug
2. Fix bug (TDD approach)
3. Run unit tests (verify fix)
4. Re-run UAT scenario (verify in real-world)
5. Update UAT results (mark as passed ✅)

### Step 6: Stakeholder Sign-off

**Get approval from**:
- Product owner (feature works as requested)
- QA team (quality standards met)
- Platform owners (if cross-platform)

- ✅ **Cross-platform** (test on all target platforms)

### Execution

- ✅ **Follow scenarios exactly** (consistency)
- ✅ **Document everything** (screenshots, logs, timing)
- ✅ **Celebrate bugs found** (finding bugs = winning)
- ✅ **Re-test after fixes** (verify bug is resolved)
- ✅ **Fresh environment** (avoid state pollution)

### Documentation

## Celebrate Early Discovery

**UAT Philosophy**: Finding bugs during UAT is a VICTORY 🎉

**Why celebrate UAT bugs**:
- Found before production (no user impact)
- Found in realistic scenarios (validates testing approach)
- Fixed while context fresh (faster resolution)
- Demonstrates rigorous quality process

**Examples of UAT wins**:
- 🎉 **Windows UAT found 5 bugs** → All fixed before merge
- 🎉 **iOS UAT found cross-platform path issues** → Fixed in 30 minutes
- 🎉 **Performance UAT revealed timeout** → Increased from 30s to 120s
- 🎉 **Error handling UAT caught poor error message** → Improved UX

**Don't hide UAT findings**:
- ❌ "We found some small issues" (downplaying)
- ✅ "UAT found 5 bugs—all fixed within 2 hours!" (celebrating)

## Key Takeaways

**Remember**:
- 📋 **UAT verifies real-world usage** (not just unit tests)
- 📋 **Use realistic data** (production-like scenarios)
- 📋 **Test on all platforms** (if cross-platform)
- 📋 **Document everything** (for traceability)
- 📋 **Celebrate bugs found** (early discovery wins)

**Philosophy**:
> "UAT is the bridge between unit tests and production. It catches issues that automated tests miss and validates that features work as users expect."

**Culture**:
> "Finding bugs during UAT is not failure—it's success. Every bug found here is a production incident prevented."
